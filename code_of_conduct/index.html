        <h1>Citizen Code of Conduct</h1>
        <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
        <p>A primary goal of {PROJECT_NAME} is <strong>to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors,</strong>
          with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, <strong>we are committed to providing a friendly,
          safe and welcoming environment for all</strong>, 
          <strong>
              regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion
          </strong> (or lack thereof).</p>

        <h2>2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>

          encouraging <strong>participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects</strong> on our community.</p>

        <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and <strong>positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality</strong>
          and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>

        <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent,
          we want to know.</p>

              even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
